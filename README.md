# moodoo

Have you ever asked - 'is is just me, or is everyone feeling this way?'

One day, I was having coffee with my friend in Marrickville, Sydney. We were discussing how many of our friends and families suffered from problems with mood - from mild mood swings to clinical mental illness. We started thinking about the subjective nature of mood and feeling - how it's hard to track your own moods day to day, and difficult to know whether you are affected by events and people around you.

We conceived of an online app that let you track your emotions, both in time and space. An app that would take the aggregate of others' moods and show you how your mood compares with your friends', your families', your city, your nation, the world. Thus Moodoo was born.

Moodoo lets you make a mood self-report, consisting of:

1) a mood rating between 1 and 10, using colourful and playful mood icons;
2) your location
3) a written record of why you think you feel how you do.

Moodoo then takes this data and allows you to see how your mood changes over time in the Mooderator, an interactive timeline, and the MoodPie, a chart that shows you what percentage of your updates fit into the different mood states - e.g. you select 'boppy' 35% of the time, 'grumpy' 10%, etc.

But this is just the beginning. We have big plans for the future of Moodoo!

These include:

- the MoodMap: a map which shows where you were when you were feeling a certain way & averages your moods over   particular areas
- a Therapeutic Mode which allows you to make detailed reports about your mental health state, with separate axes for mood,   energy level and calmness/agitation
- customization of the names & colours for the different mood states - you make up your own states for mood levels 1-10
- ability to nominate an emergency contact & warnings for when you have a series of low moods
- Reminders to update your mood via email/phone/OS notifications
- an option to publish your mood as social media stories , choosing privacy settings for different friend levels/circles in     Facebook, Google +, Twitter
- import Facebook emotion states
- Add or link images & videos to updates
- Average of all users
- Average of friend groups / circles
- Average maps
- cyclical data view - e.g. days of the week, time of month, months, seasons,
- biometric link, e.g. apple watch / android wear / proprietary devices
- access weather apis and display along with moods
- export data - PDF, Word, excel, CSV, mysql
- mood data API
